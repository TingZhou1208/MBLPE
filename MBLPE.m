% GPEA: Grey prediction evolution algorithm for global optimization
% Brief description: GPEA is a new optimization technique, the core of GPEA is considering the population series of evolutionary algorithms as a time series, and uses the even grey model as a reproduction operator to forecast the next population (without employing anymutation and crossover operators).
